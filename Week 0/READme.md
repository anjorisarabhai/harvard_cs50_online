# 🎮 Upside Down Chase

A Stranger Things-themed game built using **Scratch**, where the player races to escape the Demogorgon in the eerie, mysterious world of the **Upside Down**.

## 🧠 Concept

Inspired by the hit show **Stranger Things**, this game challenges players to:

- Survive as long as possible to achieve a high score.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- **Use Arrow Keys** to move your character.
- Avoid obstacles and enemies.
- Collect points/items (if any) while escaping.
- The game ends if you get caught by the Demogorgon or hit an obstacle.

## 🎨 Features

- **Custom Sprites & Sounds**: Created/edited in Scratch to match the atmosphere.
